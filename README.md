# About this repository

The repo contains the Vale rules customized to Kore.ai docs. These rules are based on [Microsoft Style of Writing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

It is a good reminder that the rules for great writing can't all be automated, and we (still!) need editorial input from a human.
