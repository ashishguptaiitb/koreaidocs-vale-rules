# How to enable Vale linting in VSCode

The repo contains the Vale rules customized to Kore.ai docs. These rules implement [Microsoft Style of Writing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

Remember that for great writing, we can't automate all the rules and that we (still!) need editorial inputs from a human. So, when you have a doubt, rely on a team member and ask for help.

There are two ways to use Vale with Kore docs setup:

* Vale in VSCode: *In situ*, context-sensitive reporting of issues, explanations, and option to make quick fixes is available in VS Code Editor. See [how to configure Vale in VSCode](configure-vale-in-vscode.md).
* Vale via command line: Instructions are TBD in [how to use Vale via command line](vale-command-line.md)
