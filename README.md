# About this repository

This repo contains the vale rules customized to Kore.ai docs. These rulse are derived from [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

It is good to remember that all style rules for good writing can't be automated and need a human's editorial input to.
